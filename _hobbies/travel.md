Travel was always a dream of mine, but given the fact I don't exactly come from rich family, I haven't done much traveling :cry: when I was younger. :baby:
Now, I try to catch up as much time as possible a travel when it's possible! :heart_eyes_cat: Next stop will be a trip with my mother to Berlin :de:, witch will be my
gift for her for her 55 birthday. :birthday:
