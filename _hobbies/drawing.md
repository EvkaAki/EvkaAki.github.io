I have attended the affiliated art school in Novaky for 2 years. At this point of my life, I don't usually use the traditional art tool {{ page.logo }} like before :pensive:, instead of that I'm learning
to use tools like Adobe Photoshop :+1: or Illustrator :star:.
Here is an example of something I did in the Adobe Illustrator, more specifically, its a t-shirt logo for a kid's camp boy::girl: :baby: :boy:, which was used last summer. :blush:
