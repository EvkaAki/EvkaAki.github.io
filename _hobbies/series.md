As much I would like to deny it, I love :heart: watching different series with my friends or even alone sometimes. I have developed a multitasking specialty witch allows me to do my duties like work, school assignment and so on - and at the same time to watch a movie simultaneously. I'm 100% I would do better without it, but sometimes it's the only _free time_ I can have.
