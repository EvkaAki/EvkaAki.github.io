Reading was my passion :cupid: right from the start, in the fist grade of the primary school. I remember my first book then, Herry Potter and the Secred Chamber. It took me two
weeks of constant reading, to finish it, but it was worth it.
Not long after that, I started to prefer more mature books :green_book: and more inspirational authors until the collage times begun. Sadly, now there is no time to read anymore. Even thou, I received a kindle :heart_eyes_cat: from my friend this year's birthday, so, I may find my way to literature yet again.
