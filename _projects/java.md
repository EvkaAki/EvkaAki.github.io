This project was the worst thing I have ever written in code, toping even this project. At that time, I didn't really understand what object oriented programming even means and
sadly there haven't been any good explanation in the lectures. The theme I choose was Ciname ticket managment where I implemented standard use cases as picking seats, reserving seats, buying tickets and so on.
