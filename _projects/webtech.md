Web technologies are in my humble opinion the most challenging subject I have had until now. Till the end of the semester, we have to implement a almost fully working e-shop including a administration and a live chat feature using node.js and vue.js. My project domain will have the name: clup.sk, witch indicates the sound of the water dropping on floor in Slovak, suitable name for a swimsuit e-shop :bikini: :+1:.
